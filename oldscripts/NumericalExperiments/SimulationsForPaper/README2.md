In this folder, each subfolder includes our simulation codes for each source domain assumption. There might be multiple scripts starting with the same name such as "simulation_noisy_sparseV1.py" and "simulation_noisy_sparseV2.py". These scripts are exactly the same code except that they use different seeds for simulations. We use multiple scripts to obtain more results for the experiments.
